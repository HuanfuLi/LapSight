# State: LapSight

**Initialized:** 2026-06-25
**Current Status:** Phase 5 context gathered. Ready to plan Phase 5.

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**Core value:** The user can mount a phone, record a session, and see trustworthy live lap timing plus delta-to-best with minimal interaction while moving.

## Current Focus

**Phase 5 READY — Track Setup and Course Profiles**

Phase 4 is complete and verified on-device.
We are ready to begin Phase 5 to support persistent course profiles.

Next step: Run /gsd-plan-phase 5 using 05-CONTEXT.md.

## Working Assumptions

- Project is greenfield.
- Repository: `https://github.com/HuanfuLi/LapSight.git`
- Phone companion app comes before Meta glasses integration.
- Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform is the current preferred stack.
- Lap engine must be clean-room and testable.
- Open-source references are research inputs, not direct copy sources.
- Phase 1 uses simulator-backed GPS probe state; real providers are next.

## Next Command Candidates

- Run `/gsd-discuss-phase 5` to gather context for Track Setup.
- Or `/gsd-plan-phase 5` to directly build the plans.

## Review Checklist

- [x] Confirm project name: LapSight.
- [x] Confirm stack direction: KMP + Compose Multiplatform.
- [ ] Confirm app license policy.
- [x] Complete Android runtime UAT (Phase 1).
- [x] Complete Android on-device UAT (Phase 2 lap timing).
- [ ] Complete iOS Xcode runtime UAT.
- [x] Review Phase 2 plan.
- [x] Phase 3 complete (8/8 plans, all tests pass, androidApp:assembleDebug succeeds).
- [x] Phase 4 planned (4/4 plans, decision coverage 24/24).
- [x] Phase 4 executed (4/4 plans, shared checks and Android debug build pass).
- [x] Phase 4 verified via UAT.
- [ ] Phase 5 planned.
